# simpletrace
A very basic ray tracer which works on raspberry pi

## History

A few nights ago, I was scrolling through reddit and came across the latest cool raspberry pi project someone had done, and it got me to thinking. I had been doing some fiddling myself at the start of 2015 before (luckily for me), I became a father in the May. As a result, I get now *very* little free time.

My initial motivation with this was just to create *something* that worked on raspberry pi (just because), and a simple ray tracer seemed nice and straight forward. I did however get a lot of satisfaction knowing that the little single card computer hanging out the back of the TV in my lounge was busy firing rays and drawing the results :)

Subsequently, I have all sorts of ideas I'd like to try on this project (or similar ones), but very little time to try them. My (perhaps unrealistic?) hope was that by posting it on here, someone maybe be able to take something from the code, or just be inspired to do something similar.

I'll fill out some more details here hopefully tomorrow...
